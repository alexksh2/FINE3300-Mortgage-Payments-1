# FINE3300-Mortgage-Payments

The FINE3300 Mortgage Payments project aims to develop a software to __calculate the mortgage payment for each period__ with a certain principal amount, quoted interest rate (as a
percent, for example, 4.85), and the amortization period in years.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Several payment options are available to borrowers, such as monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, weekly, rapid bi-weekly, and rapid weekly.
<br>
<li>Monthly payments mean that only one payment is made every month.</li>
<li>Semi-monthly payments mean that 2 payments are made every month, in the middle and end of the month (24 payments a year).</li>
<li>Bi-weekly payments are made every two weeks (26 payments a year). </li>
<li>Accelerated Bi-weekly payments are also made every two weeks. The payment is equal to half the monthly amount.</li>
<li>Weekly payments are made every week (52 payments a year)</li>
<li>Accelerated Weekly payments are also made every week. The payment is equal to one-quarter of the monthly amount.</li>
